					</h3>
					<div class="title"><h3>Challenge 2 - Disinformation</h3></div>
					<div class="title"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
					<p>Disinformation is a growing problem on the web. Often this information is spread through multiple social media. While disinformation itself is not a new problem; it’s spread, the rate of spread, the potential for global impact and so on are growing due to the use of social media. Social media providers themselves are concerned and examining what can be done in this space.</p>
					<p>In this year’s SBP-BRiMS second challenge problem, we ask participants to consider the issue of the spread of disinformation on the web.</p>
					<p>The specific questions of interest are:
						<ul>
							<li>Can we automatically and accurately classify a message as containing disinformation? And the related question, what are the characteristics of disinformation that make it distinct from other information?  Eligible entries might compare against Truthy.</li>
							<li>What are the characteristics of individuals or groups that put them at risk to succumbing to disinformation?  And the related question, how can you measure the extent to which an individual or group has succumbed to disinformation?  Algorithm for measuring risk must be provided and validation strategy explained.</li>
							<li>How does disinformation spread within and across media?  And the related question, does disinformation spread differently than other information?  Information on how spread was measured must be explained.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>These are the specific questions to be addressed.  Each response may address one or more of these questions. All entries must have both a strong social theory, political theory or policy perspective and a strong methodology perspective.</p>
			
					<div class="title"><h3>Rules</h3></div>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Participants may work individually or in teams.</li>
							<li>Participants must define what they mean by disinformation.</li>
							<li>Participants must use data related to at least two social media. Data from just on-line mainstream news sites is only of tertiary interest.</li>
							<li>Participants must address one of the three questions above.</li>
							<li>Participants should address a <strong>social science theory or policy relevant issue</strong> and should employ one or more methodologies appropriate for the empirical assessment of or forecasting on the basis of big data (e.g., computational algorithms, machine learning, computer simulation, social network analysis, text mining).</li>
							<li>Each participating team may prepare <strong>one or more entry</strong>.</li>
							<li>Entries must represent <strong>original work</strong> that has not been previously published or submitted to other challenges.</li>
							<li>Each participating team must <strong>send at least one member to the SBP-BRiMS 2020 conference</strong> to present a poster describing their entry, to do a presentatation that is video taped, and to, if they win, do a presentation on the last day. At least one team member must register and attend the conference.</li>
							<li>Participants are encouraged to use any data set of interest.  However, this data must be provided along with the challenge paper.  This data will become part of a public repository. To that end – a) the names of individuals in the data set (or their social media id), must be de-identified, b) the ids of specific social media posts should be replace by fake ids. If the submitting team does not know how to do that, Dr. Kathleen Carley will have a third party run a de-identifier on the data for the participating team.</li>
							<li>At the conference, all entries will be judged by the community using a participant voting system.</li>
							<li>The individual or group that submits the winning entry, and that submitting the runner-up entry, will have their <strong>full length paper describing their challenge solution published in a SBP-BRiMS special issue of the journal Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory. Submission to the challenge problem means that you consent to publish the fill length paper in this venue.</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<div class="title"><h3>Guidelines</h3></div>
					<p>A strong entry will have one or more of these components:</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Employ multiple data sets.</li>
							<li>Include a high quality visualization (note that participants will be allowed to display dynamic visualizations via some form of electronic media e.g., by hanging a tablet from the poster. However, <strong>please note that tables will not be provided.</strong></li>
							<li>Account for biases in the data across time, space, topics and sources.</li>
							<li>Provide a new metric or algorithm development such as:</li>
								<ol>
									<li>A new spatial, temporal, and network analytic methodologies and algorithms that can cope with the vast scale of open source data (e.g. Twitter data) and support answering a key social or policy issue.</li>
									<li>A new spatial analytic methodology that can better take into account change over time and non-spatial distances (such as co-occurrences and semantic similarity between locations).</li>
									<li>A new network methodology that better incorporate the diversity of actor and relationship types in the data, spatio-temporal information, or for constructing edges from the data and for distributing actor and edge attributes onto the graph.</li>
									<li>A novel simulation that supports reasoning about patterns in the opiod crisis that uses empirical data to either instantiate the model or to confirm some of the results.</li>
								</ol>
							<li>Generate a new empirical finding that challenges or provides novel support for existing social or political theory, or provides information of policy relevance.  Note, the results of computer simulation are viewed as empirical findings.</li>
						</ul>		
					</p>
					<p>In addition, a strong entry should be well-written and provide some level of creativity in its use of or combination of data.</p>
	
					<div class="title"><h3>Submitting and Entry</h3></div>
					<p><em><strong>What to Submit</strong></em></p>
					<p>You need to submit 5 things - A Challenge Paper, A PDF of your poster, a PowerPoint promotion slide, and for those who have their challenge paper accepted – a full paper and the associated dataset.

The data will be made public in the disinformation repository.</p>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Challenge Paper:</strong> A paper describing the project. This should be a maximum of 10 pages including references and figures. This should define:
								<ul>
									<li>Which of the three question is addressed?</li>
									<li>How did you focus this question down so that it was manageable?</li>
